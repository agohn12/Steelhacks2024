# SteelHacks Project 2024: One Call Away
### Team: Austin, Morgan, Ly

We are a group of three newbies trying to make a very complex program... what could go wrong?

## Introduction

1 in every 4 Americans that are over the age of 65 fall every year. That's a lot! Many of these falls result in severe complications and even death. When elderly people fall they are often unable to get up and need assistance. 

805,000 Americans every year also suffer from heart attacks, 3.4 million Americans suffere from seizures, and 2.8 million Americans also suffer from Anemia. These complications often lead to sudden collapsing. When people fall they often need assistance even if no one is around.

The goal of One Call Away, is to detect a fall, assess its severity, and autonomously call the victim's emergency contact if the victim remains fallen for more than thirty seconds. Note that in our demo, this time period is shortened to three seconds for practical purposes.

All of the code for this project can be run in one file, [NAME].py. We imported the following libraries & APIs:
* OpenCV, for doing tasks based on computer vision
* Ultralytics YOLOv8, a real-time object detection model
* Twilio, an API that makes phone calls with custom messages
* Pygame, for playing a pre-recorded audio message

In the Supplementary Files folder, you will find WIPs and additional materials that could be incorporated into [NAME].py to make object detection more robust. For example, classes.txt is an array of different objects. This could be used to distinguish people from inanimate objects.
